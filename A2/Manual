Assignment 2 Manual
---------------------------------------------
The program works as described in the assignment specifications.
There are no extra features, I have made no assumptions, and the
assignment is complete.

---------------------------------------------
Near and Far Plane:
- There are textual labels at the bottom of the program window displaying where the 
near and far planes are located.

---------------------------------------------
Clipping:
- I clipped the lines using their 3D homogeneous coordinates before normalizing
and transforming to the viewport.
- The function used to clip a line is called "clip" in "Viewer.cpp"

---------------------------------------------
I stored the following matrices in Viewer.cpp:
- m_modelScale: Stores the scaling transformations applied to the model cube
- m_modelRotTrans: Store the rotations and translations applied to the model cube
- m_view: Stores all viewing transformations
- m_perspective: Stores the perspective matrix
- m_screen: Stores the transformation from NDC to the viewport
