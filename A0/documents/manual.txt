    This program is a simple paint program. To draw a shape on the canvas, click the left 
mouse button where you want the shape to begin, drag the mouse to where you want the 
shape to end, and release the left mouse button. To quit, hit the quit button.

There are 4 menus for the program:

- The "Application" menu allows you to clear the canvas or quit the program.
- The "Tools" menu allows you to choose the shape you want to draw.
- The "Colour" menu allows you to choose the fill colour of the shape you are drawing.
    NOTE: This does not apply to the "line" shape, as it is a fill colour.
- The "Help" menu gives instructions on how to draw each shape.

The program has the following shortcuts:

- CTRL+Q: Quit the program
- C:      Clear the canvas
- L:      Choose the line tool
- O:      Choose the oval tool
- R:      Choose the rectangle tool
