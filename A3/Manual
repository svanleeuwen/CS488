Assignment 2 Manual
---------------------------------------------

I added the files sphere.cpp and sphere.hpp to build my sphere. I was being a little ambitious, and I implemented a sqrt(3)-subdivision algorithm described in Real-Time Rendering by Akenine-Moller, Haines, and Hoffman. (I would give a more precise reference, but I don't have it with me right now). I used the subdivision algorithm to turn a tetrahedron into a sphere.

---------------------------------------------

When there are no actions left to undo/redo, a message is outputted to stdout.

---------------------------------------------

I debated about whether or not Reset Joints or Reset All should reset which body parts are picked. The assignment didn't specify either way, and it made testing much easier, so I decided to reset the picked parts.

---------------------------------------------

I used Gouroud shading with the light placed at the eye.

---------------------------------------------

trackball.{cpp,hpp} are modifications to trackball.{c,h} to use Qt classes.

---------------------------------------------

My implementation depends on the puppet's origin starting at the 
world coordinates origin.

The getCameraMatrix() function that we were given assumes that the camera
is looking at the origin, so when running "a3mark.lua", passing through the
world coordinate origin gives backwards shading. I am not sure how to fix this
without completely changing the camera's functionality.
